# Python Language Features

- Dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language
  - Dynamic: we donâ€™t need to declare the data-type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language (bocz
    variable is decided at run time).
  - high level: no need to manage the memory
  - interpreted: Python code is executed line by line at a time. unlike other languages C, Java. there is no need to
    compile python code
- supports object-oriented programming & procedural oriented programming paradigm
- The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.
- Cross OS language (Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac)
- Dynamic Typing: Variables can be reassigned with to any different data type, thus python is dynamically typed
  language. since variable can change type readily. other languages like c, java are statically typed where variables
  are stuck with their originally-assigned type

# Python3 v/s Python2

- Python-2 is legacy version and outdated and Python-3 is latest and future version of Python language
- Python-3 is not backwards compatible to Python 2 (but vice-versa is true)
- Python-3 Readiness: http://chhantyal.net/py3readiness/#.X48I5J0zZUw (Tells you list of packages that are now supported
  by Python)
- latest version of python would be build upon Python-3 only

# Maths Operator

<!--
- + Addtion

-->

- PEMDAS (P- parentheses, E- exponent, M- multiplication, D- division, A- addition, S- subtraction)

---

# Comments

- Single line comment ==> #
- Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments, but you can use a multiline string. Python will ignore
  string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code

---

# Variables

- Variables Must be assigned to some value before used ==> Error : NameError: name 'variable_name' is not defined
- Syntax- variable_name: type_name
- variables are like containers for storing data, pull it out later. They can hold all sorts of things like - number,
  boolean, string, etc
- variable in python is like a variable in mathematics: it is named symbols that holds a value
- Thinking like JAR
- variables are always assigned with the variable name on the left and then the value on the right of equals sign.
- variables must be assigned before they are used
- Naming Restriction:
  - variables must start with a letter or underscore
  - rest of the variable name must consist of letters, numbers or underscores
  - variable names are case-sensitive
- Naming Conventions/Style/Guide-lines:
  - variable should be lower_snake_case (betweeen words underscore)
  - variable should be lower cases
  - constants should be CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
  - Class name should be UpperCamelCase
  - variable that starts and ends with two underscores (called dunder for double underscore) are supposed to be
  private or should left alone ex-
  <!-- __no_touch__ -->

# Data Types

- Primitive Data type:
  - Boolean Type: bool
  - Numeric Types: int, float, complex
  - Text Type: str
- Secondary Data Type: (Data-Structures)
  - Sequence Types: list, tuple, range (Ordered sequence of values like array)
  - Mapping Type: dict (Collection of key/value pairs)
  - Set Type: set, frozenset
  - Binary Type: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- Special Value: None (Similar to null in other languages)

---

# Strings

- String literals in python can be declared with either Single quotes or double quotes. (Just like JS)
- Escape Character/Sequence: this are meta-characters which get interpreted by python to do somthing special:
  - https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
- Formatting String: There are several ways to format a string in python to interpolate a variable. New way in Python3
  is F-String
- String is indexed (ie- each character has indicies)

---

# Converting DataTypes

- Can explicitly convert data type of the variable by using the built-in type as a function a1 = 12.3423 b1 = int (a1)

---

# Conditional Statements

- Syntax

```

if condition:
  _code_
elif condition:
  _code_
else:
  _code_

```

- Comparsion Operators: ==, !=, <, >, >=, <=
- Logical Operators: and, or, not

---

# Truthiness or Falseness

- Truthiness : Statements or expressions which resolve to true boolean value.
- Values can that can be resolved to boolean true is Truthy or value can be be resolved to boolean false is falsy
- Beside false condition checks, other things that are naturally falsy include: empty objects, empty String, None and
  Zero
- Difference between "==" v/s is: (Both are used to check condition oeprator) ==> Comparsion Operator
  - == only check for values are same?
  - is: check for values and stores in the same memory ('is' operator is only truthy if the vairables reference the
    same item in the memory)

---

# For Loops

- Syntax:

```

for item in iterable_object:
  # logic

```

- An iterable_object is like - collection of items, ex- a list of numbers, a string of characters, a range, etc.
- item is a temporary variable which reference the current position of our iterator with in the iterable. It will
  iterate over every item of the collection and then go away when it has visited all the items in the collection
- range(1,8) ==> Generates numbers from 1 to 7
- range() - think ranges as just a slice of number line.
  - If we want to print numbers we can simply iterate over range()
  - range(7) will give you integers from 0 to 6
  - range(1, 8) will give you integers from 1 to 7
  - range(1, 10, 2) will give you odds from 1 to 10
  - range(7, 0, -1) will give you integers from 7 to 1 (Third param is step ==> How many to skip, also +ve -> count up
    or -ve -> count down)

---

# While loops

- Anything that can be done by for loops can also be done by while loops.
- Something done by while loops cannot be done by for loops.
- While loops require extra care i.e- should have condition that will manually terminates.(If not termiate: It will be
  in infinite loops)
- Syntax:

```

while boolean_expression:
  # while above condition is truthy this block of code will be executed

```

- break- allows us to exit the loops (while, for) explicitly (whenever we want) <-- Controlled Exists

# Style Guide For Python

- pep-8 styleguide (python enhancement proposal)
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- 4 space = 1 Indentation
- If you want to use auto-linting tool in VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting
- In general you can use: autopep8 --in-place <file_name.py> (No separate installation required in linux)

---

# List

- Collection or grouping of items
- This ds is ordered collection of elements
- data structure is higher of data-type (Secondary data types) which is general stores the primary data-type in
  particular fashion (i.e- structured way)
- Lists in python (in js - array)
- list always starts counting at ZERO. Thus your first element lives at index-0
- slices can be used to make the copy of the list
- list comprehension is used everywhere when iterating over list, string, ranges, and more data types
- swapping is useful for sorting or shuffling

---

# Difference b/w functions and method

- function: function is a sequence of statements that execute in a certain order, given a name. They let us implement
  code reusability.
- Python Functions, we talked about built-in and user-defined functions. ex- len('ab'), type(a)
- Python method is like a function, except it is attached to an object. We call a method on an object, and it possibly
  makes changes to that object. A method, then, belongs to a class. ex: list1.sort(), [1,2,3].sort(), str1.upper()
- Basically methods depends on any object (in front/prefix of it), whereas functions are on its own.

---

# Dictionary

- Consist of key/value pairs
- Can use key to describe our data (meta-data) and value to represent the actual data
- keys are always numbers and string
- In Dictionary there is no guarantee of order

---

# Tuples

- An order collection or grouping of items
- syntax: uses () rather than [] <- used in list/array
- It is immutable (i.e- src Cannot be modify/changed)
- What makes Tuples a good DS
  - Tuples are faster than list/array
  - It makes your code safer from bugs (statically typed)
  - can be used as valid keys in the dictionary
  - some methods return them to you- like .items() when working with dictionaries!
- Tuples can be used as keys in the dictionary but list cannot be the key of dictionary
- Tuples are faster than list and useful for protecting data
- tuples are immutable

---

# Set

- sets are unordered collection of elements, the are immutable!
- Set are like formal mathematical sets
- Set do not have duplicate values
- Elements are not order
- You cannot access items in a set by index
- sets can be useful if you need to keep track of collection of elements, but don't care about ordering, key or values
  and duplicates
- There is no order for items present in the set, can be stored in random order

---

# Functions

- A process for execution a task
- It can accept input and provides output
- Useful for executing similar procedure over and over again
- built-in functions: print(), list.append(), etc.
- Why use Functions?
  - Using functions stay DRY : Don't Repeat Yourself!, don't be WET (Write Everything Twice)
  - Clean up our code and prevent duplications
  - "Abstract away" code for other users (Imagine you need to re-write the logic everytime you call that function)
- return
  - exist the function
  - we can return single or multiple values (using tuples)
  - pops the function off of the call stack
- arguments vs parameters
  - parameters is a variable in method definition
  - when a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into method's parameters
  - Parameters is a variable in the declaration of function
  - Arguments is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function
- Difference between default params and keyword arguments
  - default parameters: when you define a function and use a -> = operator, you are setting a default parameter.
  - keyword arguments: when you invoke a function and use a -> = operator, you are making a keyword arguments.
- Functions are procedure for executing code. They accept input and return outputs when the return keyword is used.
- To create inputs, we make parameters which can have default values, we call those default values parameters
- variables defined inside of function are scoped to that function
- when invoking a function we can pass in keyword arguments in any order.
- Be careful to not return too early in your conditional logic and refactor when you can to remove unnecessary
  conditional logic. Make sure you don't return in loop too early as well.

---

# Scope

- where our variable can be accessed
- Function scope- variable that are defined inside a function are scoped in that function boundaries
- global scope and nonlocal scope
- nonlocal scope - let us modify the parent function variable in the child (nested) function

---

# More About functions

## \*args

- A special operator we can pass to a function
- Gather reaming arguments as a tuple
- This is just a parameter- you can call it whatever you want

---

## \*\*kwargs

- kwargs -> key-word arguments (full-form)
- A special operator we can pass to a function
- Gather reaming keyword arguments as a dictionary
- This is just a parameter- you can call it whatever you want

---

## Parameters Ordering

- function parameters should follow below order
  1. parameters
  2. \*args
  3. default parameter
  4. \*\*kwargs
- Note: very specific arguments should be at the starting and more generic arguments like \*args, default parameter
  should be at the last

---

# Use-case of Lambda functions

- Basically lambda functions are anonymous functions
- Use-case: when we have a function which takes arguments as another function which will never be used in future, it is
  better to declare it lambda

---

# map

- A standard function that accepts at atleast two arguments, a function and an "iterable"
- iterable- something that can be iterated over (lists, strings, dictionaries, set, tuples)
- runs the lambda for each value in the iterable and returns a map object which can be converted into another
  data-structure
